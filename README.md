# 🤖🎙️ AI Voice Assistant with Flask UI

This is my **Mega Python Project** where I built an **AI Voice Assistant** that can listen 🎤, speak 🔊, and also has a **Flask-based web interface 🌐**.  
The assistant can open websites 🌍, play music 🎶, fetch live news 📰, and respond to commands with speech output 💬.  

I created this project to practice **Python 🐍, Flask 🌐, APIs 🔑, and Voice Technologies 🎤** together in one complete application. 🚀

## ✨ Features

- 🎤 **Voice Input** → Listens to microphone input using SpeechRecognition  
- 🔊 **Voice Output** → Responds using Windows SAPI text-to-speech  
- 🌍 **Web Browsing** → Opens Google, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.  
- 🎶 **Music Player** → Plays songs from a custom music library  
- 📰 **Live News** → Fetches top headlines from **NewsAPI**  
- 💻 **Flask UI** → Simple web interface to control the assistant  

Basically, this is a mini **Jarvis (Iron Man AI) 🦾** built with Python 😃
